## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains sales records from a supermarket, with features such as:
- **Invoice ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction
- **Branch**: Store branch location
- **Customer Type**: Member or non-member
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer
- **Product Line**: Categories of products sold
- **Total**: Total amount for each transaction
- **Payment Method**: Cash, Credit Card, or E-wallet
- **Ratings**: Customer satisfaction rating

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this analysis are:
1. To analyze the distribution of sales across different branches and product lines.
2. To study customer purchasing patterns based on gender, customer type, and payment method.
3. To evaluate customer satisfaction ratings and their correlation with other factors.
4. To identify key drivers of sales and provide recommendations to optimize store performance.

## Analysis Techniques

The analysis in this project includes the following steps:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, formatting data, and transforming variables as needed.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing various aspects of the dataset, such as sales distribution across branches, customer demographics, and product lines.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis to study relationships between different variables.
- **Revenue Trends**: Analysis of revenue generated per branch and product line, along with time-based patterns.
- **Customer Insights**: Understanding customer demographics and preferences based on sales data.

### Visualizations

- **Branch-wise Sales Comparison**: A bar chart showing the total sales of each branch.

## Key Insights

1. **Sales Distribution**: The supermarket's sales are not evenly distributed across branches. Branch X has the highest total sales, while Branch Y needs improvement in attracting more customers.
2. **Customer Preferences**: Male customers tend to spend more on electronics, while female customers show a preference for health and beauty products.
3. **Payment Methods**: E-wallet payments are increasingly popular among younger customers, indicating a shift in preferred payment methods.
4. **Customer Satisfaction**: Customer satisfaction is generally high, but there is a notable dip in ratings for transactions made via credit cards, which could indicate friction in the payment process.

## Conclusion

The supermarket chain can take several steps to optimize sales:
- Focus marketing efforts on boosting sales in underperforming branches.
- Explore partnerships with electronic payment platforms to cater to the growing E-wallet preference.
- Offer targeted promotions on health and beauty products, especially for female customers.
